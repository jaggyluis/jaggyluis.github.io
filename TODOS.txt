X include seatconfig if available
X implement loadfactor
X apply other aiplane pax types
X loading csv and/or json files in
X interpolate granularity
X assign gates to output?
X turnaround time for planes with no tt - by plane type
X gate choice needs to be more effective:
	X plane size/area
X implement time frame
X implement filter
X implement better filter
X implement passenger filter
X add gender to profile output
X implement seconds on decimalDayToTime
X implement actual gates if available 
X convert all to code refactor// major overhaul
X add padding to tt

X reevaluate efficient padding based on:
	- % of time landed
	- size of plane
	- fix null

X track down richard to confirm aircraft codes:
	*-* - what is that
	X design reference code
	X arc

X fix aircraft stats
X implement module pattern
X number of passengers output
X implement domestic/international?
X research better passenger profiles?
X fix Summary.txt
X implement combined tests
X fix broken trace
X allow for profile saves
X swap flights to be their own table
X finish separating the module into a legible format
X fix padding on gate assignment 
X fix double table bug
X save json objects from flight data
X filter passengers
X update passenger profiles to include browsing
X apply arrival times

X assign global variable to determine distribution modulo

X modify passenger distribution times
X add terminal to flight output
X remove aviation._GLOBALS from flight and pax

X transfer passengers have null values
X fix checkin distribution null passengers
X implement airline clustering
X cull bad departing passenger data

- more discrete types - pre 9am and correlate arrival times with bags

- passenger survey data weighting
- implement fit curve on arrival distributions
___________________________________________

- add fast charts and integrate visualisation to main app
- multiple visualization for profile type parallel coords
____________________________________________

- web worker for simulation
- move data/profile builder to server side
- implement npm for module build - major refactor
